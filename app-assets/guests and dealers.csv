She has a degree in Art and Theater Design from Valparaiso University and has quite a number of theater productions under her belt. The theater life was tossed to the side, however, when she discovered her love of making cosplay costumes at her first convention in 2013, and she hasn't looked back since!

Ramencon is her first table, but she has done quite a few cosplays in those two years, and doesn't look to slow down yet! Cosplays, accessories, plushies - if it can be sewn, she can make it!
